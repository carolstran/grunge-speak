## Background

In 1992, the New York Times published an article about grunge culture in Seattle that ignited the infamous `Grunge Speak` scandal (also known as `Grungegate`). At the end of the article, there was a "Lexicon of Grunge" that was... just ridiculous. So those are the terms used in this extension.

And yes, I kept the grunge terms in all caps to add some flair âœ¨
